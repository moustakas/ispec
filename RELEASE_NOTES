   IOVERSCAN - new CONSTANT_OVERSCAN keyword added

2005-Jul-26

   ISTARSEARCH() - bug fix when precessing coordinates (thanks to Andy
      Marble)

2005-Jul-24

   REPAIR_LA_COSMIC_CRPIX - restore pixels improperly flagged as
      cosmic rays by LA_COSMIC.

2005-Jul-20

   ITRACESPEC - use ROBUST_POLY_FIT() in favor of POLY_FIT(); added
      TRACE_MINCOL and TRACE_MAXCOL optional inputs; removed internal
      routine FIT_TRACE()

   I2DSTARFIT() - new routine to subtract a point source (e.g., a
      foreground star) from the 2D spectrum before extraction

   IEXTRACT/IDOEXTRACT - STARFIT keyword now calls I2DSTARFIT()

   ISPEC_WEBPAGE - added NOPSCONVERT keyword

   ICRCOMBINE - Bug fix.  If CR_REJECT rejects all pixels from an
      image stack, then interpolate smoothly over those pixels
      (previously, CR_REJECT was setting the error to 0.0, which gave
      infinities when sky subtracting, etc.).

##########
ISPEC v2.0
##########

2005 Apr-July

Documentation was generally cleaned up and improved.  Copyright
notices were added to every routine.  The standard-star directories
were totally re-organized: The calspec database was updated with
2004-Jun-15 version spectra, and STDPATH in the IBATCH parameter file
is now obsolete.  Both the EQUINOX and EPOCH keywords are now
supported.  Support for the one-dimensional bad pixel spectrum has
been suspended in the new extraction code, IDOEXTRACT.  Combining CR
splits *and* cosmic-ray rejection now occurs before sky subtraction,
because CR's can affect the sky fit.  In retrospect, the wavelength
and distortion maps should have been written as binary FITS tables
rather than IDL save sets; perhaps this will be changed in a
far-future version of iSPEC2d.

Major developments: ICRCOMBINE() now solves for integer pixel shifts
among sequential exposures.  Asymmetric extraction apertures now can
be specified in IEXTRACT or IDOEXTRACT.

   IDOEXTRACT - new routine to extract one-dimensional spectra using
      the two-dimensional wavelength maps; sky-subtracted spectra are
      assumed; several new header parameters

   IDOSPEC - new wrapper routine for IDOEXTRACT

   IEXTRACT - HELIOCOR keyword removed; SEEING keyword added;
      LOAPERTURE and UPAPERTURE optional inputs added, which allows
      asymmetric extraction apertures to be defined in either this
      routine or IDOEXTRACT; several new header parameters

   ISENSFUNC() - totally re-written (see the detailed modification
      history)

   IBATCH - various changes incorporating the new routines and
      reduction procedures; removed TELLLIST and TELLURIC optional
      inputs

   ISEEING - this routine is now somewhat obsolete, but it may remain
      useful if traditional (re-sampling) wavelength calibration is
      carried out; the median seeing is now computed in IDOEXTRACT if
      the SEEING keyword is set

   ICALIBRATE - changed NOSENSERR keyword to EXCLUDE_SENSERR; the
      default is to propagate the error in the sensitivity
      function; removed TELLURIC keyword in favor of the TELLFITS
      optional input (see implementation in IFLUXCALIBRATE)

   IPARSE_QALOGFILE() - improved documentation and updated to be
      consistent with the new ISENSFUNC() log output

   IQAPHOTO - improved documentation and postscript output

   IALL - various changes incorporating the new routines and
      reduction procedures; added FLUXCALIBFILE optional input;
      removed TELLFILE optional input; added SENSNAME optional input 

   IFLUXCALIBRATE() - new routine to flux-calibrate the
      two-dimensional, sky-subtracted spectra using the
      two-dimensional wavelength map

   ISKYSHIFT() - improved centroiding that relies on more than just
      the 5577 sky line; use iterative flux- and gaussian-weighted
      centroiding rather than a gaussian fit to the sky lines;
      improved SKYLINES.DAT file

   IOVERSCAN - simplify the OVERSCAN header keyword (no longer follows
      the IRAF convention); SPLINE_OVERSCAN keyword and BKPT_OVERSCAN
      optional input added

   ITRIM - simplify the TRIM header keyword (no longer follows the
      IRAF convention); remove the CCDSEC header keyword

   IRDSENSFUNC() - the sensitivity functions no longer handle the
      telluric spectra

   RD2DSPEC() - simpler treatment of reading in the SKY and WAVEMAP
      extensions; slight speed improvement by using FITS_READ instead
      of MRDFITS(); converts the 2D wavelength map trace set into a
      double precision 2D image; improved reading of the telluric
      spectrum, if present

   ISKYSUBTRACT2D - write out the 2D wavelength map used for the
     b-spline sky subtraction as a fourth FITS extension; bug fix: the
     inverse variance input to BSPLINE_ITERFIT() was commented out,
     which prevents iterative rejection (thanks to Christy Tremonti);
     bug fix: floor the sky aperture to be at least one pixel (row)
     wide; bug fix in the way the error in the sky subtraction was
     being computed; bug fix: FORAGE was not being properly indexed
     within the FOR loop on SKYLIST

   WRT2DSPEC - write out the 2D wavelength map trace set (passed by
     ISKYSUBTRACT2D) as the fourth FITS extension and the telluric
     spectrum (passed by IFLUXCALIBRATE or ICALIBRATE) as the fifth
     extension

   IHEADER_UPDATE() - EPOCH and EQUINOX keywords are now supported;
      added MJD-OBS header keyword, which is now read by IFORAGE();
      *ALL* IRAF header keywords are removed here!!

   ICRCOMBINE - average the MJD-OBS values; changed the default NSIG
      parameter to increase the number of iterations; wrote
      FIND_PIXSHIFT() subroutine to solve for an integer pixel shift
      before images are combined

   ARM_OPTEXTRACT - new optimal extraction routine written by Andy
      Marble and imported into iSPEC

   WRITE_STANDARDS_DATABASE - new routine to re-organized the
      standard-star database; UPDATE_STANDARDS_DATABASE and
      READ_STANDARDS_TABLE now obsolete

   WRITE_BINNED_STANDARDS - new routine to generate binned
      standard-star spectra for CALSPEC

   ISTARSEARCH() - new routine excised from ISPEC_MAKELISTS for
      identifying standard stars from a coordinate list; added
      STARINFO optional input

   ISPEC_MAKELISTS - use ISTARSEARCH(); generalized internal
      subroutine WRITE_PARAMFILE

   ARM_ZEROCOMBINE and ARM_FLATCOMBINE - new routines written by
      A. Marble now part of ISPEC; these should be used in favor of
      ICALIBAVG()

   IARCFIT_MAKEFILE - new routine (replacing IARCFIT_WRAPPER) to
      generate a file of initial line positions from arc lamps, the
      output of which can be passed to IARCFIT via the ARC_PIXEL
      keyword

   ISPEC_COUNT_CRPIX - new, simple routine to count the number of
      pixels affected by cosmic rays given a FITS file list

   ITRACESPEC - slightly modified QA plot

   ISKYMASK() - slight cosmetic improvements; only mask 5577 and 6300
     sky lines

   IARCFIT - minor bug fix (thanks to A. Marble)

   IRESTORE_WMAP - documentation improved; the wavelength map is now
      restored in double precision
 
   I1DNAMES() - documented; prefix 'w' removed to be consistent with
      IDOEXTRACT

   IHEADER_CHECK - more informative error messages

   ISPEC_WEBPAGE - documented and improved slightly

   ISPEC_CREATE_PNG - documented; image scaling improved substantially

   INICE_LINENAME() - documented

   IMASK_BITS - documented

   ICHOOSE_WMAP - documented

   FMTAPERTURE - documented

ISPEC v1.1
##########

2005-Jan-19

   IEXTRACT - Previously, if either NOSKYSHIFT *or* NOSKYSUB were set,
      then no sky-line shift was applied.  Now, this only occurs if
      NOSKYSHIFT by itself is set.

2005-Jan-14

   ISKYSUBTRACT2D - Added new optional keyword NORDER_SKY.

   ICONSTRUCT_TELLURIC - new routine written

   ILAMPRES() removed in favor of IM_SPECRES_LAMP() in IMPRO
