jm07jun20nyu --- Downloaded and updated the Calspec (2006-Sep-01)
database, which now includes stars spanning a wider color range.
Also, the AB magnitude zero-point for Calspec and SPEC50CAL was
changed to 48.6.

jm05jun01uofa --- The CTIONEWCAL fluxed standards have now been
superseeded by Bessell (1990), and should not be used.  All the
standards in the "data" directory have been placed on a common AB
magnitude system according to

   m = -2.5 log (f_nu) - 48.59

(Hamuy et al. 1994) **EXCEPT** Oke (1983).  Therefore, the Oke (1983)
standards will have a 0.01 mag error in the absolute standard-star
calibrations until I get around to fixing this.  The Oke (1990)
standards were already on the appropriate AB magnitude system when I
downloaded them from the site indicated in the README.  The "obsolete"
directory now contains the CTIONEWCAL standards.  

jm05apr14uofa --- The "data" directory contains the original and
binned standard-star spectra.  The objects in the "standards"
directory have been written by WRITE_STANDARDS_DATABASE to be a unique
set of standard-star spectra.  Also see "ispec_standards.fits" in the
standards directory.
