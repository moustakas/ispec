L745 was excluded from the database because no blue spectra exist.
Also, Bessell (1999) states: "The published spectrophotometric data
for the white dwarfs L745-46A and VMa2 have lower precision that for
the Hamuy et al. (1994) stars..."

BV photometry is taken from Table 2 of Bessell (1999).

Hamuy et al. 1992, 1994

Spectra obtained from ftp://ftp.eso.org/pub/stecf/standards/ctiostan.
Only the faint spectrophotometric (tertiary) standards are included.

Spectra are in units of Angstroms and AB magnitude, in bandpasses of
width 50 Angstroms.

m = -2.5 log f_nu - 48.59
