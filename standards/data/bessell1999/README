Spectrum zero-point changed to 48.6 (AB).

Bessell's spectra in mJy were downloaded.  The final spectra were
written in AB magnitudes using the routine WRITE_BESSELL99 in the
SPECTRA sub-directory.  I did not use Bessell's files which have the
fluxes tabulated in AB magnitudes because he assumes a zero-point of
48.60, rather than 48.59 which Hamuy et al. (1994) assume, and I
assume throughout iSPEC.  To convert from Bessell's milli-Jansky to AB
magnitudes, let F=flux in mJy and m=AB magnitude, then

   m_AB = -2.5 log (F*1E-29)-48.59

Note that the eg21a.tab file on Bessell's website has a duplicate
entry for 3300 Angstroms.

BV photometry has been taken from the original paper, and matches the
photometry in CTIONEWCAL.

The last flux point in f110.tab was commented out because it involved
an extrapolation.  So were the last three points in eg21.tab.  Fixed
typos in l7379.tab on the fourth- and second-to-last wavelength
points.  The last three wavelength points in l7987.tab were commented
out to prevent extrapolation.

updated.

Bessell 1990, PASP, 111, 1426 

Spectra obtained from http://www.mso.anu.edu.au/~bessell/FTP.  Only
the faint spectrophotometric standards in Table 2 are included.  
However, we exclude VMA 2, L745-46A, L745-46A, HD 140283, and EG 131.

Spectra are in units of Angstroms and AB magnitude, in bandpasses of
width 50 Angstroms.
