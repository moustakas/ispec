The "missing" Calspec standards (see below) were found in Simbad and
the database was updated to the latest (2006-Sep) distribution.  Note:
P041C=GSPCP41-C, P177D=GSPCP177-D, P330E=GSPCP330E.  Also,
WRITE_BINNED_STANDARDS was re-run with 48.6 as the AB magnitude
zero-point.

BV photometry was taken from
http://kahuna.stsci.edu/instruments/observatory/cdbs/calspec.html.  I
also decided to bin the standards in 10-Angstrom bandpasses.  Note
that I adopt the AB-magnitude conversion:

   m_AB = -2.5 log (f_nu)-48.6

Calspec database updated with 2004-Jun-15 version spectra.  Added SDSS
standard BD+174708.  Binned standards recomputed with
WRITE_CALSPEC_BANDPASSES.  Information table converted to sextractor
format and updated.

Spectra are in units of Angstroms and AB magnitude, in bandpasses of
width 50 Angstroms as written by WRITE_CALSPEC_BANDPASSES.

The README in the subdirectory SPECTRA has more detailed information
on the stars.  The star HZ43B was removed from the list of FITS
spectra due to limited spectral coverage.  The following objects had
uncertain coordinates in SIMBAD:

GD108
GD153
GD50
LTT9491

The following objects could not be found in SIMBAD:

P041C
P177D
P330E

and were therefore not included.
