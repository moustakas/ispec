  CALSPEC

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*CALSPEC:* 2004 June 15

CALSPEC contains the composite stellar spectra that are the fundamental
flux standards for HST calibrations. All files are in machine
independent binary FITS table format. Information about the pedigree of
a given spectrum is in the header of the FITS table file, which can be
read with the IRAF hedit task or by mrdfits.pro in IDL.

The Table below summarizes the set of recommended standard star spectra.
Columns 2 and 3 give the V and B magnitudes of the stars. More
documentation on these stars, eg. coordinates, finding charts and
spectral types can be found in Turnshek et al. (1990), Bohlin, Colina &
Finley (1995), and Colina & Bohlin (1997). Column 4 is the computer
compatible file name with the plus and minus signs converted to
underscores. Thus, the actual CALSPEC file name is the prefix in column
4, plus one of the suffixes in columns 5-8, plus ".fits". For example, a
standard that has STIS data is "bd_28d4211_stis_001.fits".

The pure hydrogen WD model LTE spectra of Bohlin (2000) are now Hubeny
NLTE models calculated with his Tlusty code (Bohlin 2003). These
fundamental primary standards GD71, GD153, and G191B2B are listed by
Calibration Data Base System (CDBS) suffix in column 5 of the Table and
provide the basis for the secondary flux standards. The observational
spectra from columns 6-8 can be compared with the models; and in the
case of G191B2B, there is ultraviolet line blanketing at the ~1 percent
level. The model calculations extend to 30 microns and cover the long
wavelength limits of 2.7 microns for NICMOS, 1.1 microns for STIS and
ACS, and 27 microns for JWST. Vega was observed by STIS (Bohlin &
Gilliland 2004a); and the new composite flux standard
alpha_lyr_stis_002.fits consists of IUE data from 1256-1675A, STIS CCD
fluxes from 1675-4200A, and a specially tailored Kurucz model longward
of 4200A (Kurucz 2003) and from 900-1256A. The STIS and ACS observations
of the SDSS standard BD+17d4708 are documented in Bohlin & Gilliland
(2004b).

Column 6 lists the 20 CDBS suffix names for the second choice standard
stars with STIS data from Bohlin, Dickinson, & Calzetti (2001).
Tabulated in column 7 are the next best standard star flux
distributions, which are composed of FOS spectra in the UV and Oke
spectra at the longer wavelengths. Also appearing in column 7 are the
three solar analogs that are comprised of FOS observation but do not
have "_FOS" in the CALSPEC file name.

The names for the last, but largest, set of standard stars appear in
column 8 of the Table. The application of corrections to the original
IUE and optical fluxes produces a consistent set of spectrophotometric
standards from 1150 to 9200A (Bohlin 1996 and references therein). This
set of standards is composed of IUE+Oke data only.

CALSPEC also contains the ultraviolet to near-infrared absolute flux
distribution of the Sun (filename: sun_reference_stis_001.fits) to 2.7
microns, which is used to model the IR spectrum of the three solar
analog stars. The solar reference spectrum combines absolute flux
measurements from satellites and from the ground with a model spectrum
for the near-infrared (Colina, Bohlin, & Castelli 1996).

The order of preference for the choice of a standard flux distribution
is from left to right in the Table, i.e. from the best in column 5 to
the last choice with the lowest quality in column 8.
