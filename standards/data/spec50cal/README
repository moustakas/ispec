The SPECTRA directory contains the original spectra of 25
spectrophotometric standard stars from Massey, Strobel, Barnes, &
Anderson 1998, ApJ, 328, 315.  The data were obtained electronically
from the Astronomical Data Center from GSFC at
http://adc.gsfc.nasa.gov/adc-cgi/cat.pl?/catalogs/3/3116/.  Each data
file has an extensive header, wavelength in Angstroms and the
corresponding magnitude based on the Hayes & Latham (1975)
calibration:

	m = -2.5 * log_10 ( f_nu ) - 48.59

where f_nu is in [erg/s/cm^2/Hz].  The magnitude of Vega at 5556
Angstrom is defined to be 0.04.  The spectra have been parsed using
WRITE_BINNED_STANDARDS and 10 Angstrom bandpasses.

The file table1.dat is directly from the paper.  

BV photometry has been taken from the original Massey paper.

PG0934554 has been excluded because there are no data between
5281-5541 Angstroms.
