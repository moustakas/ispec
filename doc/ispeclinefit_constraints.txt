Constraints on ISPECLINEFIT().

* OII doublet, H_delta, H_gamma, H_beta, OIII doublet, OI 6300, NII
  doublet, H_alpha, SII doublet

* Balmer and forbidden line widths and redshifts are tied together

* Initial mask width:  20 Angstroms, then 5*sigma of the mean
  line-width of well-fitted emission lines.  Also mask negative pixels
  and telluric wavelengths.

* Initial emission line width:  105 km/s.

* IBACKFIT:  initial guess on the template coefficients is equal
  contributions; initial guess on the reddening is 0.0 and the
  reddening is tied together for all the templates; O'Donnell Galactic
  reddening curve, normalized at 5500 A

Questions
---------

Why don't the coefficients sum to 1.0?
